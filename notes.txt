What to do, in order:

1. Make Board class
Should have:
 - int[][] _board
 - boolean[][] _modifiable
 - Board(int width, int height)
 - Board()
 - void generate(int numIncluded)
 - String toString()
 - int getTile(int r, int c)
 - int setTile(int r, int c, int newVal)
 - boolean isSolved()

LATER:
 - void solve()

2. Make a Game class
   TK

3. Convert to Processing
   Add display methods to Game class

4. Implement backtracking solving algorithms
   and try to visualize them in some way

5. Package it together, so that a player is able
   to either solve the sudoku themself or use
   the computer solver

FLUFF: 
6. Map numbers to different pictures (like waifus / husbandos)
